  <h1><strong>Rye:</strong> a Hassle-Free Python Experience</h1>
</div>

!!! note

    Rye is no longer developed. We encourage all users to use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/), the
    [successor project](https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2024/8/21/harvest-season/) from the same
    maintainers, which is actively maintained and much more widely used.

    For current Rye users, please see the [uv migration guide](./guide/uv.md). While Rye will
    continue to be available, no further updates are planned, including security updates.

Rye is a comprehensive project and package management solution for Python.
Born from [its creator's](https://github.com/mitsuhiko) desire to establish a
one-stop-shop for all Python users, Rye provides a unified experience to install and manages Python
installations, `pyproject.toml` based projects, dependencies and virtualenvs
seamlessly.  It's designed to accommodate complex projects, monorepos and to
facilitate global tool installations.  Curious? [Watch an introduction](https://youtu.be/q99TYA7LnuA).

A hassle-free experience for Python developers at every level.
